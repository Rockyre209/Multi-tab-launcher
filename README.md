## 💡 Why I Made This

As someone who explores cracked software, games, movies, and professional tools frequently, I was tired of repeating the same process daily:
- Open Firefox
- Visit multiple niche websites
- Manually type the same keyword
- Get overwhelmed with tabs or miss out on good sources

It was boring. Wasteful. And not worthy of someone who values time and flair 😏

So I built this flirty, Python-based launcher to automate it all.

### 🎯 The Problem:
Manual searching is slow and inefficient. Especially across many sites.

### 💎 The Innovative Solution:
- Script launches Firefox
- Categorized tab control
- Sexy little pauses to avoid system lag
- And a fun, bold personality baked right in 💋
