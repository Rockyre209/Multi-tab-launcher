## 💡 Why I Made This

As someone who often explores cracked software, games, movies, and tools across a wide range of niche websites, I found myself stuck in a repetitive loop:
- Opening Firefox manually
- Typing the same keyword across 10+ websites
- Getting lost in endless tabs or missing good sources

This manual routine was boring, time-consuming, and far from efficient for a high-performing techie like me 😴

## 🧠 The Problem It Solves

🧨 The Problem:
Opening multiple websites and searching for the same content manually wastes:
- Time
- Energy
- Focus  

💎 The Innovative Solution:
- This script **clusters sites by category**
- Takes **one keyword** as input
- Opens **5 tabs at a time** (so your system isn’t overwhelmed)
- Adds a **flirty UI twist** for fun and personality 🥵  
- Works entirely **offline and locally**, making it lightweight and secure

---

## 🌸 Notes

- You can easily modify the `sites` dictionary to add/remove platforms.
- Script opens 5 tabs at a time — hit **Enter** to load more.
- If Firefox isn’t found, update the `firefox_path` in the script.
